Supply Chain Management Smart Contract
This is a smart contract for managing a supply chain network, built using Solidity. The contract contains several functionalities for creating and verifying products, managing inventory, conducting financial transactions, and handling the final sale of each product within the network. The contract also includes functionalities for monitoring environmental data, receiving customer feedback, and viewing the history of each product in the network.

The smart contract is split into nine files, each containing a set of related functionalities:

SupplyChain.sol: Contains the basic data structures and functions for creating and verifying products within the supply chain network.
ProductManagement.sol: Contains functions for managing the lifecycle of each product within the network, including verification, delivery, and payment release.
AccessControl.sol: Contains modifiers for restricting access to certain functions within the network based on the caller's role (manufacturer, distributor, or retailer).
History.sol: Contains a function for viewing the history of each product in the network, including its state and timestamp at each point in its lifecycle.
CustomAttributes.sol: Contains functions for setting custom product attributes (such as weight, dimensions, and expiration date) and monitoring environmental data (such as temperature and humidity).
FinancialTransactions.sol: Contains functions for managing financial transactions within the network, including releasing payments to the distributor and refunding payments to the retailer.
InventoryManagement.sol: Contains functions for managing the inventory of products within the network, including adding and removing products from the distributor's inventory.
DeliveryPayment.sol: Contains a function for verifying the delivery of each product and releasing the second half of the payment to the distributor.
SalesFeedback.sol: Contains a function for handling the final sale of each product and receiving customer feedback.

The smart contract is designed to be as efficient as possible in terms of gas usage, while also prioritizing security and data integrity. The contract is thoroughly tested and optimized to ensure that it can handle a large volume of products and transactions within the network.
