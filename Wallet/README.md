Wallet Smart Contract
This smart contract provides a secure and efficient way to store and transfer Ether between multiple parties. The contract owner can add and remove authorized users, and authorized users can deposit and withdraw Ether from the wallet.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
You will need to have a Solidity compiler installed in order to use this smart contract.

Usage
To use this smart contract, you can simply deploy it to the Ethereum network and interact with it using a web3-enabled wallet or other Ethereum-compatible application.

Adding an Authorized User
The contract owner can add an authorized user by calling the addAuthorizedUser function and providing the Ethereum address of the user.

Removing an Authorized User
The contract owner can remove an authorized user by calling the removeAuthorizedUser function and providing the Ethereum address of the user.

Depositing Ether
Authorized users can deposit Ether into the wallet by calling the deposit function and specifying the amount of Ether to be deposited.

Withdrawing Ether
Authorized users can withdraw Ether from the wallet by calling the withdraw function and specifying the amount of Ether to be withdrawn and the Ethereum address to which the Ether should be sent.

Optimization
This smart contract has been optimized to minimize gas usage and ensure maximum efficiency.

Security
This smart contract has been designed with security in mind and includes various features to prevent vulnerabilities and attacks. For example, the onlyOwner and onlyAuthorized modifiers ensure that only the contract owner and authorized users can perform certain actions, while the require statements ensure that users cannot deposit more Ether than is available in the contract and that only authorized users can withdraw Ether.
