Contracts
This project includes several Solidity contracts:

NFT.sol: This contract implements the ERC721 interface and allows for the creation of NFTs with a given name and symbol. It includes a function to mint new NFTs with a given tokenId.
NFTMarketplace.sol: This contract is the main NFT marketplace contract, and includes functions for creating, canceling, and buying NFTs. It also includes a mapping of tokenIds to saleIds, and events for tracking sale activity.
NFTMarketplaceFactory.sol: This contract allows users to create new instances of the NFT marketplace and associated NFT contracts.
Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Compile and deploy the NFTMarketplaceFactory.sol contract to the Ethereum network.
Use the createMarketplace function of the NFTMarketplaceFactory contract to create a new NFT marketplace and associated NFT contract.
Use the createSale function of the NFTMarketplace contract to create a new sale for an NFT.
Use the cancelSale function of the NFTMarketplace contract to cancel a sale and return the NFT to the seller.
Use the buy function of the NFTMarketplace contract to purchase an NFT and transfer it to the buyer.
